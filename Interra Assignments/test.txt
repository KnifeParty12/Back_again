31   34   I amar prestar aen.

34   36   The world is changed.

36   37   Han mathon ne nen.

37   39   I feel it in the water.

39   41   Han mathon ne chae.

41   43   I feel it in the earth.

44   45   A han noston ned 'wilith.

45   48   I smell it in the air.

49   51   Much that once was...

51   52   ...is lost.

53   56   For none now live who remember it.

69   73   It began with the forging of the great rings.

74   76   Three were given to the elves:

76   79   Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

81   83   Seven to the dwarf-lords:

83   88   Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

88   90   And nine...

90   93   ...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

93   97   ...who, above all else, desire power.

98   103   For within these rings was bound

105   108   But they were all of them deceived.

108   110   For another ring was made.

111   114   In the land of Mordor,

115   119   ...the Dark Lord Sauron forged

120   122   ...to control all others.

122   126   And into this ring he poured

126   130   ...and his will to dominate all life.

131   135   One Ring to rule them all.

136   138   One by one...

138   142   ...the free lands of Middle-earth

143   146   But there were some who resisted.

146   151   A last alliance of men and elves

151   156   And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they

168   171   Tangado haid!

171   174   Leithio i philinn!

186   189   Victory was near.

193   196   But the power of the ring...

196   198   ...could not be undone.

222   224   It was in this moment...

224   227   ...when all hope had faded...

227   231   ...that Isildur, son of the king,

262   268   Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples

275   278   The ring passed to Isildur...

278   282   ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

283   285   But the hearts of men...

285   287   ...are easily corrupted.

288   292   And the ring of power has a will of its own.

318   320   It betrayed Isildur...

322   324   ... to his death.

329   332   And some things

333   335   ...were lost.

336   338   History became legend...

338   340   ...legend became myth.

341   343   And for two and a half thousand years...

344   347   ... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

348   351   Until, when chance came...

351   354   ...it ensnared a new bearer.

356   361   My precious.

361   363   The ring came to the creature Gollum...

364   367   ... who took it deep into the tunnels

368   371   And there it consumed him.

371   373   It came to me.

373   378   My own. My love. My own.

378   382   My precious.

386   390   The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

390   394   For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

394   398   And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

399   402   Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

402   405   Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

405   408   ... whispers of a nameless fear.

408   411   And the ring of power perceived...

412   414   ...its time had now come.

417   420   It abandoned Gollum.

420   425   But something happened then

426   430   It was picked up by the most

430   431   What's this?

432   433   A hobbit.

433   436   Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

436   438   A ring.

438   440   Lost!

443   444   My precious is lost!

444   446   My precious is lost!

447   449   For the time will soon come...

449   454   ... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

459   461   The 22nd day of September......

462   465   ...in the year 1400...

466   468   ...by Shire-reckoning.

468   474   Bag End, Bagshot Row.

474   476   ...the Shire...

476   479   ...Middle-earth.

484   487   The third age of this world.

499   501   There and back again.

503   505   A Hobbit's tale.

505   509   By Bilbo Baggins.

514   516   Now...

516   518   ...where to begin?

520   521   Ah, yes....

525   527   "Concerning...

528   530   ...Hobbits."

531   534   Hobbits have been living and farming

535   537   ...for many hundreds of years...

537   540   ...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

540   543   ...by the world of the big folk.

544   549   Middle-earth being, after all,

549   552   ...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

553   557   ...being neither renowned as great warriors...

557   561   ...nor counted among the very wise.

565   568   Frodo! Someone at the door.

570   572   In fact, it has been remarked by some...

572   577   ... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

577   579   A rather unfair observation...

580   583   ...as we have also developed a keen

584   586   ...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

587   590   But where our hearts truly lie...

590   592   ...is in peace and quiet...

593   595   ...and good, tilled earth.

595   600   For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

603   608   And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

608   613   But today of all days.

614   620   It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

624   627   Frodo, the door!

631   633   Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

633   635   Frodo!

641   644   Down from the door where it began

649   653   And I must follow if I can

654   658   The road goes ever on and on

658   661   Down from the door where it began

662   666   Now far ahead the road has gone

667   671   And I must follow if I can

674   678   A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

679   683   Nor is he early.

695   698   It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

702   705   You didn't think I'd miss

707   709   How is the old rascal?

710   713   I hear it's going to be a party

714   716   You know Bilbo.

716   718   Well, that should please him.

718   720   Half the Shire's been invited.

721   723   And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

726   730   And so life in the Shire goes on...

730   733   ... very much as it has this past age.

733   738   Full of its own comings and goings,

739   741   If it comes at all.

742   745   For things are made to endure in the Shire...

746   749   ...passing from one generation to the next.

750   754   There's always been a Baggins

755   756   ...in Bag End.

759   762   And there always will be.

762   766   To tell you the truth,

767   769   I mean, more than usual.

770   772   He's taken to locking himself in his study.

774   778   He spends hours and hours poring over

791   792   Where's it gone?

819   821   He's up to something.

829   832   - All right, then. Keep your secrets.

832   834   But I know you have something to do with it.

834   835   Good gracious me.

835   838   Before you came along, we Bagginses

838   839   Indeed.

840   842   Never had any adventures

842   848   If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.

848   852   All I did was give your uncle

852   856   Whatever you did, you've been officially

857   859   Oh, really?

864   866   Gandalf! Gandalf!

872   874   Fireworks, Gandalf!

877   879   - Gandalf!

898   899   Gandalf?

900   904   - I'm glad you're back.

908   910   So am I.

942   943   No, thank you!

944   947   We don't want any more visitors,

948   951   And what about very old friends?

955   956   Gandalf?

957   960   - Bilbo Baggins.

961   965   Good to see you. 111 years old!

967   969   You haven't aged a day.

976   978   Come on, come in!

978   981   Welcome, welcome.

982   984   Oh, here we are.

986   988   Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

989   992   I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

993   996   Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

998   1002   It was laid down by my father.

1003   1005   Just tea, thank you.

1012   1013   I was expecting you sometime last week.

1013   1017   Not that it matters. You come and go as

1017   1022   You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.

1022   1026   There's some cheese here.

1026   1030   We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

1031   1034   But not much for afters.

1035   1037   I've just found some sponge cake.

1041   1042   I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

1046   1048   - Just tea, thank you.

1049   1052   - You don't mind if I eat, do you?

1053   1055   Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

1055   1056   I'm not at home!

1063   1065   It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

1065   1067   - I know you're in there!

1068   1070   They've never forgiven me for living this long.

1071   1073   I've got to get away from these confounded

1074   1076   ...never giving me a moment's peace.

1076   1080   I want to see mountains again.

1080   1085   And then find somewhere quiet

1085   1089   - So you mean to go through with your plan?

1089   1091   All the arrangements are made.

1093   1095   Oh, thank you.

1096   1098   Frodo suspects something.

1098   1100   Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

1101   1103   ...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle

1104   1106   You will tell him, won't you?

1107   1109   - Yes, yes.

1112   1113   I know.

1116   1119   He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

1120   1123   I think in his heart, Frodo's

1124   1127   The woods, the fields.

1127   1129   Little rivers.

1134   1136   I am old, Gandalf.

1138   1143   I know I don't look it, but I'm

1145   1148   I feel thin.

1148   1150   Sort of stretched...

1151   1154   ...like butter scraped over too much bread.

1155   1159   I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

1159   1162   And I don't expect I shall return.

1165   1168   In fact, I mean not to.

1171   1174   Old Toby.

1192   1195   Gandalf, my old friend...

1195   1197   ...this will be a night to remember.

1220   1221   Hello, hello.

1222   1226   Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.

1227   1229   Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

1232   1235   - I think I'll just have another ale.

1237   1238   Go on!

1249   1250   So there I was...

1251   1255   ...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

1255   1257   And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

1257   1259   ...about how they were going to cook us.

1260   1264   Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit

1266   1269   They spent so much time arguing

1269   1273   ...that the sun's first light

1274   1276   ...and turned them all to stone!

1282   1283   Quickly.

1287   1289   Up they go!

1292   1294   No no, the big one - big one

1303   1305   Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.

1306   1308   Are all these children yours?

1308   1311   Good gracious, you have been productive.

1313   1314   Bilbo?

1316   1317   Sackville-Bagginses!

1318   1319   Quickly, hide!

1329   1331   Thank you, my boy.

1332   1335   You're a good lad, Frodo.

1336   1339   I'm very selfish, you know.

1339   1343   Yes, I am. Very selfish.

1343   1345   I don't know why I took you in after

1346   1347   ...but it wasn't out of charity.

1348   1349   I think it was because...

1349   1351   ...of all my numerous relations...

1352   1355   ...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

1356   1357   Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

1358   1359   No.

1360   1362   Well, yes, but that's not the point.

1362   1366   The point is, Frodo...

1369   1371   ...you'll be all right.

1374   1376   - Done!

1376   1378   - It is in the ground.

1378   1380   This was your idea.

1395   1397   Bilbo.

1398   1401   Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

1401   1404   Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon

1418   1421   - That was good.

1423   1427   Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

1428   1429   I might've known.

1435   1437   Speech, Bilbo!

1438   1440   Speech!

1440   1441   Speech!

1446   1448   My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

1449   1451   ...Tooks and Brandybucks...

1452   1454   ...Grubbs, Chubbs...

1454   1455   ...Hornblowers...

1456   1458   ...Bolgers...

1459   1460   ...Bracegirdles...

1460   1463   ...and Proudfoots.

1465   1468   Today is my 111th birthday!

1470   1472   Happy birthday!

1472   1476   But alas, eleventh-one years is

1476   1479   ...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

1480   1483   I don't know half of you

1483   1487   ...and I like less than half of you

1498   1500   I have things to do.

1506   1508   I've put this off for far too long.

1512   1516   I regret to announce this is the end!

1517   1519   I'm going now.

1520   1523   I bid you all a very fond farewell.

1525   1526   Goodbye.

1559   1562   I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

1563   1566   Come on, Gandalf.

1566   1569   There are many magic rings in

1569   1571   ...and none of them should be used lightly.

1572   1574   It was just a bit of fun.

1574   1578   Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

1579   1582   - You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

1583   1585   As often as I can spare them.

1586   1589   - I'm leaving everything to him.

1589   1592   - Is that staying too?

1593   1597   It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

1598   1601   No. Wait, it's...

1603   1606   ...here in my pocket.

1611   1614   Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

1616   1619   Yet, after all, why not?

1621   1625   - Why shouldn’t I keep it?

1626   1628   Is that so hard?

1628   1630   Well, no.

1632   1634   And yes.

1636   1639   Now it comes to it,

1639   1641   It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

1641   1645   - There's no need to get angry.

1645   1647   It's mine.

1649   1651   My own.

1651   1655   - My precious.

1656   1658   It's been called that before, but not by you.

1659   1661   What business is it of yours

1661   1664   I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

1664   1667   - You want it for yourself!

1667   1672   Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

1672   1675   I am not trying to rob you.

1681   1682   I'm trying to help you.

1691   1694   All your long years, we've been friends.

1694   1697   Trust me as you once did.

1699   1700   Let it go.

1701   1704   You're right, Gandalf.

1706   1709   The ring must go to Frodo.

1710   1713   It's late. The road is long.

1713   1716   Yes, it is time.

1718   1723   Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

1758   1761   I've thought up an ending for my book:

1763   1768   "And he lived happily ever after

1768   1771   And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

1773   1774   Goodbye, Gandalf.

1777   1779   Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

1787   1791   The road goes ever on and on...

1794   1796   Until our next meeting.

1824   1827   It's mine. My own.

1828   1831   My precious.

1831   1834   Riddles in the dark.

1834   1836   Bilbo!

1836   1837   Bilbo!

1841   1844   My precious.

1846   1848   Precious.

1848   1851   He's gone, hasn't he?

1854   1856   He talked for so long about leaving...

1857   1859   ...I didn't think he'd really do it.

1864   1866   Gandalf?

1874   1876   Bilbo's ring.

1876   1878   He's gone to stay with the elves.

1879   1882   He's left you Bag End.

1885   1888   Along with all his possessions.

1888   1891   The ring is yours now.

1894   1897   - Put it somewhere out of sight.

1897   1899   - There are some things that I must see to.

1900   1904   - Questions. Questions that need answering.

1905   1907   I don't understand.

1911   1912   Neither do I.

1915   1917   Keep it secret.

1918   1919   Keep it safe.

1954   1957   Shire!

2012   2016   Here follows the account of Isildur,

2016   2020   ...and the finding of the ring of power."

2023   2025   "It has come to me.

2026   2029   The One Ring.

2029   2032   All those who follow in my bloodline

2033   2036   ...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

2037   2039   It is precious to me...

2040   2043   ...though I buy it with great pain.

2046   2050   The markings upon the band begin to fade.

2050   2055   The writing, which at first was as clear

2055   2059   A secret now that only fire can tell."

2076   2079   Shire...

2079   2081   ...Baggins.

2082   2086   There's no Bagginses around here.

2087   2089   That way.

2093   2095   "Hey ho to the dock I go

2095   2097   To heal my heart and drown my woe

2097   2100   Rain may fall and wind may blow

2100   2102   But there still be...

2102   2103   ...many miles to go

2104   2105   Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

2106   2108   And the stream that falls from hill to plain

2108   2110   Better than rain or rippling brook

2110   2112   Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"

2116   2119   There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

2119   2123   Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

2124   2125   War is brewing.

2126   2128   The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

2129   2131   Far-off tales and children’s stories, that's all that is.

2131   2136   You're beginning to sound like that old

2136   2139   Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

2139   2141   And proud of it.

2141   2143   - Cheers, Gaffer.

2143   2147   Weel it's none of our concern what

2148   2152   Keep your nose out of trouble,

2155   2157   - Good night, lads.

2158   2162   Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

2162   2165   Mind who you're sweet-talking.

2165   2169   Don't worry, Sam.

2170   2172   Does she?

2172   2175   - Good night, Sam.

2200   2202   Is it secret? Is it safe?

2211   2213   What are you doing?

2226   2229   Hold out your hand, Frodo.

2229   2230   It's quite cool.

2234   2235   What can you see?

2237   2239   Can you see anything?

2242   2244   Nothing.

2244   2246   There's nothing.

2247   2249   Wait.

2253   2255   There are markings.

2257   2260   It's some form of Elvish.

2260   2263   There are few who can.

2263   2268   The language is that of Mordor,

2269   2270   Mordor!

2270   2272   In the common tongue, it says:

2272   2276   "One Ring to rule them all...

2276   2278   ...One Ring to find them...

2279   2281   ...One Ring to bring them all...

2281   2284   ...and in the darkness bind them."

2286   2288   This is the One Ring...

2288   2293   ...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron

2294   2297   Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

2298   2301   Bilbo found it.

2301   2303   - In Gollum's cave.

2304   2308   For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

2308   2312   ...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

2312   2317   But no longer, Frodo.

2317   2319   The ring has awoken.

2320   2322   It's heard its master's call.

2322   2326   But he was destroyed.

2332   2334   No, Frodo.

2335   2338   The spirit of Sauron endured.

2339   2344   His life force is bound to the ring,

2344   2346   Sauron has returned.

2347   2349   His orcs have multiplied.

2350   2354   His fortress at Barad-dûr

2354   2358   Sauron needs only this ring to cover

2359   2361   He is seeking it.

2361   2365   Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

2365   2368   For the ring yearns above all else...

2368   2371   ...to return to the hand of its master.

2372   2374   They are one...

2374   2377   ...the ring and the Dark Lord.

2377   2378   Frodo...

2379   2380   ...he must never find it.

2381   2382   All right.

2382   2386   We put it away. We keep it hidden.

2387   2389   No one knows it's here, do they?

2395   2396   Do they, Gandalf?

2397   2400   There is one other who knew

2402   2405   I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

2405   2407   But the enemy found him first.

2409   2411   I don't know how long they tortured him.

2412   2416   But amidst the endless screams and

2416   2418   Shire!

2419   2420   Baggins!

2420   2422   Shire.

2422   2425   Baggins.

2428   2429   Who goes there?

2431   2432   Take it, Gandalf!

2433   2434   - Take it!

2434   2436   - You must take it!

2436   2440   - I'm giving it to you!

2441   2443   I dare not take it.

2444   2446   Not even to keep it safe.

2447   2449   Understand, Frodo...

2450   2454   ...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

2459   2465   But through me, it would wield a power

2465   2468   - But it cannot stay in the Shire!

2470   2472   No, it can't.

2477   2479   What must I do?

2480   2484   - You must leave. And leave quickly.

2484   2487   Get out of the Shire.

2488   2489   Bree.

2489   2491   - What about you?

2492   2494   ...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

2494   2498   - And the ring will be safe there?

2498   2500   I don't have any answers.

2502   2507   I must see the head of my order.

2508   2510   He'll know what to do.

2510   2513   You'll have to leave the name

2513   2516   That name is not safe outside the Shire.

2517   2520   Travel only by day.

2521   2524   I can cut across country easily enough.

2526   2528   My dear Frodo.

2528   2531   Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

2531   2534   You can learn all that there is to

2534   2536   And yet, after a hundred years...

2537   2539   ...they can still surprise you.

2540   2542   Get down.

2554   2557   Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!

2558   2559   I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

2559   2562   I was just cutting the grass under

2562   2565   A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

2565   2568   - I heard raised voices.

2568   2569   Nothing important.

2570   2572   That is, I heard a good deal

2572   2574   ...and something about the end of the world but...

2574   2578   Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.

2579   2581   No?

2582   2583   Perhaps not.

2585   2588   I've thought of a better use for you.

2590   2593   Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

2594   2596   Be careful, both of you.

2597   2599   The enemy has many spies in his service:

2600   2603   Birds, beasts.

2604   2606   Is it safe?

2608   2609   Never put it on...

2610   2613   ...for the agents of the Dark Lord

2613   2615   Always remember, Frodo...

2615   2618   ...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

2619   2621   It wants to be found.

2661   2663   This is it.

2664   2666   This is what?

2666   2668   If I take one more step...

2669   2673   ...it'll be the farthest away

2677   2679   Come on, Sam.

2687   2689   Remember what Bilbo used to say:

2689   2693   - "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."

2693   2698   You step onto the road,

2698   2702   ... there's no knowing where

2716   2718   Sam.

2721   2722   Wood-elves.

2736   2740   They're going to the harbor

2740   2742   To the Grey Havens.

2743   2745   They're leaving Middle-earth.

2745   2747   Never to return.

2750   2752   I don't know why...

2753   2755   ...it makes me sad.

2757   2762   Everywhere I lie there's a dirty

2763   2764   Just shut your eyes...

2764   2767   ...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

2767   2771   ...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

2781   2783   It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

2783   2786   I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

2789   2791   Me neither, Sam.

2820   2823   Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

2823   2824   The hour grows late.

2825   2828   And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

2829   2831   ...seeking my counsel.

2831   2835   For that is why you have come, is it not?

2835   2836   My old friend.

2837   2838   Saruman.

2843   2846   - You are sure of this?

2847   2849   So the ring of power has been found.

2850   2853   All these long years, it was in the Shire.

2853   2856   - Under my very nose.

2857   2861   Your love of the halfling's leaf

2862   2866   But we still have time.

2866   2868   Time?

2869   2871   What time do you think we have?

2872   2875   Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

2876   2878   He cannot yet take physical form...

2878   2881   ...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

2882   2886   Concealed within his fortress,

2887   2893   His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

2895   2898   You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

2899   2904   A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

2905   2907   The eye of Sauron.

2907   2909   He is gathering all evil to him.

2910   2912   Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

2912   2915   ...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

2915   2917   You know this?

2918   2920   How?

2920   2922   I have seen it.

2922   2925   A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

2926   2928   Why?

2928   2931   Why should we fear to use it?

2934   2937   They are not all accounted for,

2938   2941   We do not know who else may be watching.

2943   2946   The hour is later than you think.

2946   2949   Sauron's forces are already moving.

2951   2954   The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

2954   2955   The Nine?

2955   2958   They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

2959   2961   ...disguised as riders in black.

2961   2965   - They've reached the Shire?

2967   2969   And kill the one who carries it.

2970   2971   Frodo!

2984   2988   You did not seriously think that a hobbit

2989   2992   There are none who can.

2994   2997   Against the power of Mordor...

2997   3000   ...there can be no victory.

3002   3005   We must join with him, Gandalf.

3006   3008   We must join with Sauron.

3011   3014   It would be wise, my friend.

3014   3016   Tell me...

3016   3018   ...friend...

3018   3022   ...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

3062   3064   I gave you the chance of...

3065   3068   ...aiding me willingly...

3068   3072   ...but you have elected the way of pain!

3095   3097   Mr. Frodo?

3097   3099   Frodo? Frodo!

3101   3104   - I thought I'd lost you.

3104   3107   - It's just something Gandalf said.

3108   3112   "Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."

3112   3116   Sam, we're still in the Shire.

3119   3120   Frodo.

3120   3122   - Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.

3122   3124   Get off him.

3124   3126   Come on, Frodo.

3126   3128   What's the meaning of this?

3128   3131   You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

3132   3135   You get back here!

3136   3137   Get out of my field!

3137   3140   You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

3140   3143   I don't know why he's so upset.

3143   3144   And some cabbages.

3145   3147   And those three bags of potatoes

3148   3152   - And then the mushrooms the week before.

3152   3154   ...he's clearly overreacting.

3154   3156   Run!

3169   3172   Oh, that was close.

3173   3176   I think I've broken something.

3177   3179   Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

3180   3183   What? That was just a detour.

3183   3186   - Short cut to what?

3194   3196   That's mine.

3199   3200   That's nice, Merry.

3201   3203   Here's a nice one, Sam.

3203   3205   I think we should get off the road.

3215   3216   Get off the road!

3216   3218   Quick!

3231   3232   Be quiet!

3298   3300   What was that?

3333   3335   Anything?

3335   3337   Nothing.

3338   3340   What is going on?

3340   3344   That Black Rider was looking for something.

3346   3347   Frodo?

3348   3349   Get down!

3366   3368   I have to leave the Shire.

3369   3371   Sam and I must get to Bree.

3371   3373   Right.

3374   3376   Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

3385   3386   Run!

3387   3389   This way! Follow me!

3393   3394   Run!

3407   3409   Get the rope, Sam!

3412   3413   Frodo!

3414   3415   Run, Frodo!

3416   3417   Go!

3417   3419   Frodo, come on!

3421   3423   - Come on! Faster!

3438   3442   - How far to the nearest crossing?

3456   3458   Come on.

3469   3472   - What do you want?

3476   3479   Hobbits. Four hobbits!

3479   3483   What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.

3483   3486   We wish to stay at the inn.

3488   3490   All right young sir, I meant no offense.

3490   3493   It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

3493   3496   There's talk of strange folk abroad.

3496   3498   Can't be too careful.

3518   3521   Out of the way!

3546   3547   Excuse me.

3548   3551   Good evening, little masters.

3551   3557   If you're looking for accommodation, we got

3557   3562   Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

3563   3565   Underhill. My name's Underhill.

3567   3569   - Underhill, yeah.

3569   3572   - Can you tell him we've arrived?

3573   3574   Gandalf.

3575   3577   Oh, yes...

3577   3579   ...I remember. Elderly chap.

3580   3583   Big grey beard, pointy hat.

3583   3585   Not seen him for six months.

3592   3593   What do we do now?

3600   3601   Sam...

3602   3603   ...he'll be here. He'll come.

3606   3608   Get out of my way!

3611   3612   What's that?

3613   3615   This, my friend, is a pint.

3615   3617   It comes in pints?

3617   3621   - I'm getting one.

3627   3631   That fellow's done nothing but

3635   3636   Excuse me.

3638   3641   That man in the corner. Who is he?

3642   3646   He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous

3647   3651   What his right name is, I've never heard,

3654   3655   Strider.

3668   3671   Baggins...

3674   3677   Baggins...

3682   3684   Baggins...

3685   3688   Baggins...

3688   3691   Baggins...

3692   3694   He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

3695   3698   He's my second cousin,

3698   3700   ...and my third cousin, twice removed....

3705   3706   - Pippin!

3736   3738   You cannot hide.

3741   3744   I see you.

3746   3749   There is no life...

3749   3751   ...in the void.

3751   3753   Only...

3754   3755   ...death.

3761   3766   You draw far too much attention

3771   3772   What do you want?

3772   3774   A little more caution from you.

3775   3778   - I carry nothing.

3778   3780   I can avoid being seen if I wish...

3781   3784   ...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

3785   3787   - Who are you?

3789   3790   Yes.

3790   3794   Not nearly frightened enough.

3798   3800   Let him go!

3802   3806   You have a stout heart, little hobbit.

3806   3809   You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

3809   3810   They're coming.

3894   3896   What are they?

3898   3900   They were once men.

3900   3902   Great kings of men.

3903   3906   Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them

3907   3910   Blinded by their greed,

3910   3913   One by one, falling into darkness.

3913   3916   Now they are slaves to his will.

3918   3920   They are the Nazgûl.

3920   3923   Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

3924   3925   At all times they feel...

3925   3927   ... the presence of the ring...

3927   3932   ...drawn to the power of the One.

3942   3945   - Where are you taking us?

3953   3957   How can we know this Strider

3957   3960   I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

3961   3964   ...and feel fouler.

3965   3968   We have no choice but to trust him.

3968   3971   - But where is he leading us?

3974   3977   - To the house of Elrond.

3978   3980   We're going to see the elves.

4002   4006   - Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.

4007   4009   - You've already had it.

4009   4012   What about second breakfast?

4015   4018   Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

4019   4024   What about elevenses? Luncheon?

4024   4028   - He knows about them, doesn't he?

4034   4035   Pippin!

4052   4055   What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

4094   4096   Who is she?

4097   4099   This woman you sing of.

4103   4105   'Tis the lady of Luthien.

4105   4110   The elf-maiden who gave her

4112   4115   What happened to her?

4117   4119   She died.

4123   4126   Get some sleep, Frodo.

4136   4140   The power of Isengard is at your command...

4140   4144   ... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

4148   4154   Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

4159   4164   What orders from Mordor, my lord?

4164   4166   We have work to do.

4209   4213   The trees are strong, my lord.

4214   4216   Rip them all down.

4243   4246   This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.

4248   4250   We shall rest here tonight.

4262   4265   These are for you.

4266   4268   I'm going to have a look around.

4271   4273   Stay here.

4275   4277   My tomato's burst.

4278   4279   Could I have some bacon?

4280   4282   Want a tomato, Sam?

4282   4286   - What are you doing?!

4286   4288   - We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.

4289   4293   - Put it out!

4301   4303   Go!

4356   4358   Back, you devils!

4441   4443   Frodo!

4447   4448   Oh, Sam.

4486   4487   Strider!

4489   4495   - Help him, Strider.

4496   4501   This is beyond my skill to heal.

4506   4507   Hurry!

4507   4511   We're six days from Rivendell!

4511   4513   Hold on, Frodo.

4514   4516   Gandalf!

4579   4581   Gwaihir - Go.

4674   4677   Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

4679   4682   Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

4685   4686   Is he going to die?

4687   4691   He's passing into the shadow world.

4697   4700   - They're close.

4701   4702   - Athelas?

4702   4703   Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

4704   4707   It may help to slow the poisoning.

4721   4725   What's this, a ranger caught off his guard?

4750   4752   Frodo.

4768   4770   Who is she?

4771   4772   Frodo.

4773   4776   - She's an elf.

4779   4781   He's not going to last.

4781   4783   We must get him to my father.

4784   4787   - I've been looking for you for two days.

4787   4793   There are five wraiths behind you.

4801   4802   What are they saying?

4809   4810   I do not fear them.

4820   4821   Arwen...

4822   4825   ...ride hard. Don't Look back.

4830   4834   What are you doing?!

4949   4952   Give up the halfling, She-elf.

4953   4955   If you want him, come and claim him.

5009   5011   No. No!

5015   5017   Frodo, no.

5017   5019   Frodo, don't give in.

5020   5022   Not now.

5033   5035   What grace is given me...

5036   5038   ...let it pass to him.

5038   5040   Let him be spared.

5041   5043   Save him.

5055   5060   - Where am I?

5061   5067   And it is 10 o'clock in the morning

5069   5073   - Gandalf!

5075   5078   And you're lucky to be here too.

5078   5082   A few more hours and you would

5083   5086   But you have some strength in you,

5094   5097   What happened, Gandalf?

5098   5103   - Why didn't you meet us?

5108   5109   I was delayed.

5111   5115   A friendship with Saruman

5119   5123   One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

5124   5126   Embrace the power of the ring...

5127   5130   ...or embrace your own destruction!

5132   5136   There is only one lord of the ring.

5136   5140   Only one who can bend it to his will.

5141   5145   And he does not share power.

5159   5162   So you have chosen...death.

5173   5176   Gandalf? What is it?

5177   5179   Nothing, Frodo.

5180   5182   Frodo!

5183   5185   - Sam.

5186   5188   Sam has hardly left your side.

5189   5191   We were that worried about you.

5191   5196   By the skills of Lord Elrond,

5198   5201   Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

5250   5253   - Bilbo!

5253   5255   Bilbo.

5260   5262   There and back again

5262   5264   A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

5268   5271   - This is wonderful.

5271   5275   ...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

5276   5278   ...visit Lake-town...

5278   5281   ...see the Lonely Mountain again.

5282   5287   But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

5299   5301   I miss the Shire.

5301   5306   I spent all my childhood pretending

5307   5310   Off with you, on one of your adventures.

5313   5317   But my own adventure turned out

5322   5325   I'm not like you, Bilbo.

5327   5329   My dear boy.

5333   5337   - Now, what have I forgotten?

5338   5339   No harm in being prepared.

5340   5342   - I thought you wanted to see the elves.

5342   5345   - More than anything.

5345   5347   It's just....

5348   5351   We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

5351   5354   We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.

5355   5358   ...seeing as how you're on the mend,

5358   5360   Off home.

5364   5366   You are right, Sam.

5368   5371   We did what we set out to do.

5372   5374   The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

5378   5381   I am ready to go home.

5381   5383   His strength returns.

5384   5389   That wound will never fully heal.

5390   5392   And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

5393   5396   ...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary

5397   5400   It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

5400   5405   - We can ask no more of Frodo.

5406   5410   Sauron's forces are massing in the East.

5411   5413   And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

5414   5417   Our list of allies grows thin.

5418   5420   His treachery runs deeper than you know.

5421   5424   By foul craft, Saruman

5425   5427   He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

5427   5432   An army that can move in sunlight

5432   5434   Saruman is coming for the ring.

5435   5439   This evil cannot be concealed

5439   5443   We do not have the strength to

5447   5448   Gandalf...

5450   5452   ...the ring cannot stay here.

5472   5475   This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

5475   5478   They must decide now how to end it.

5479   5482   The time of the elves is over.

5483   5487   Who will you look to when we've gone?

5487   5492   They hide in mountains seeking riches.

5494   5497   It is in men that we must place our hope.

5497   5499   Men?

5500   5503   Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

5503   5507   The blood of Numenor is all but spent,

5508   5511   It is because of men the ring survives.

5512   5513   I was there, Gandalf.

5514   5517   I was there 3000 years ago...

5523   5526   ... when Isildur took the ring.

5526   5530   I was there the day the strength of men failed.

5532   5535   Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

5537   5540   I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

5541   5544   ...where the ring was forged,

5544   5547   Cast it into the fire!

5552   5556   - Destroy it!

5557   5559   Isildur!

5560   5564   It should have ended that day,

5569   5573   Isildur kept the ring.

5574   5577   There's no strength left in the world of men.

5578   5582   - They're scattered, divided, leaderless.

5583   5586   One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

5588   5591   He turned from that path a long time ago.

5592   5594   He has chosen exile.

5625   5627   You are no elf.

5627   5629   Men of the South are welcome here.

5630   5633   - Who are you?

5635   5637   Then we are here on common purpose...

5638   5639   ...friend.

5655   5657   The shards of Narsil.

5661   5665   The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

5668   5671   It's still sharp.

5680   5682   But no more than a broken heirloom.

5709   5712   Why do you fear the past?

5713   5718   You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

5719   5722   You are not bound to his fate.

5723   5727   The same blood flows in my veins.

5730   5732   The same weakness.

5735   5738   Your time will come.

5738   5742   You will face the same evil.

5793   5796   You said you'd bind yourself to me...

5798   5803   ...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

5804   5806   And to that I hold.

5806   5809   I would rather share one lifetime with you...

5810   5814   ...than face all the ages of this world alone.

5822   5826   I choose a mortal life.

5827   5831   - You cannot give me this.

5835   5837   ...like my heart.

5853   5857   Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

5857   5861   ...you've been summoned here

5862   5866   Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.

5867   5870   You will unite, or you will fall.

5870   5875   Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

5877   5880   Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

5894   5896   So it is true.

5906   5907   The ring of power...

5909   5911   The doom of men...

5913   5915   In a dream...

5917   5920   ...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

5920   5922   ...but in the West a pale light lingered.

5923   5925   A voice was crying:

5925   5928   "Your doom is near at hand.

5929   5932   Isildur's bane is found."

5936   5937   Isildur’s bane.

5938   5938   Boromir!

5963   5966   Never before has any voice uttered the

5967   5970   I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

5970   5972   ...for the black speech of Mordor...

5973   5974   ...may yet be heard...

5974   5977   ...in every corner of the West!

5978   5980   The ring is altogether evil.

5981   5982   It is a gift.

5983   5985   A gift to the foes of Mordor.

5985   5987   Why not use this ring?

5988   5990   Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

5991   5995   ...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.

5995   5997   ...are your lands kept safe.

5999   6003   Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.

6004   6007   You cannot wield it. None of us can.

6008   6012   The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.

6013   6016   And what would a ranger know of this matter?

6016   6018   This is no mere ranger.

6019   6023   He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

6023   6026   You owe him your allegiance.

6030   6032   Aragorn.

6034   6037   This is Isildur’s heir?

6039   6042   And heir to the throne of Gondor.

6049   6052   Gondor has no king.

6054   6055   Gondor needs no king.

6062   6066   Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

6067   6070   You have only one choice.

6070   6073   The ring must be destroyed.

6078   6080   What are we waiting for?

6093   6096   The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

6096   6100   ...by any craft that we here possess.

6101   6105   The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

6105   6109   Only there can it be unmade.

6110   6112   It must be taken deep into Mordor...

6113   6117   ...and cast back into the fiery

6120   6122   One of you...

6122   6124   ...must do this.

6127   6131   One does not simply walk into Mordor.

6132   6135   Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

6136   6140   There is evil there that does not sleep.

6141   6145   The great eye is ever-watchful.

6146   6148   It is a barren wasteland...

6148   6151   ...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

6152   6156   The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

6156   6160   Not with 10,000 men could you do this.

6160   6165   Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?

6165   6167   And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

6168   6172   And if we fail, what then? What happens

6173   6178   I will be dead before I see the

6180   6182   Never trust an elf!

6184   6189   Do you not understand? While you bicker

6190   6193   None can escape it!

6211   6213   I will take it.

6216   6218   I will take it.

6224   6227   I will take the ring to Mordor.

6235   6236   Though...

6240   6241   ...I do not know the way.

6243   6247   I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

6248   6251   ...as long as it is yours to bear.

6252   6255   If by my life or death I can protect you...

6256   6257   ...I will.

6261   6263   You have my sword.

6265   6267   And you have my bow.

6268   6270   And my ax.

6277   6280   You carry the fates of us all, little one.

6282   6286   If this is indeed the will of the Council...

6286   6289   ...then Gondor will see it done.

6291   6296   - Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.

6296   6301   ...even when he is summoned to a

6302   6303   Hey. We're coming too!

6306   6308   You'll have to send us home

6309   6312   Anyway, you need people

6312   6313   ...mission.

6314   6315   Quest.

6316   6317   Thing.

6319   6321   Well, that rules you out, Pip.

6323   6325   Nine companions.

6327   6328   So be it.

6329   6332   You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

6332   6334   Great!

6335   6337   Where are we going?

6383   6387   In her heart, your mother knew

6387   6389   That you'd never escape your fate.

6390   6393   The skill of the elves can reforge

6394   6397   ...but only you have the power to wield it.

6399   6401   I do not want that power.

6401   6404   I have never wanted it.

6405   6408   You are the last of that bloodline.

6412   6415   My old sword! Sting.

6415   6416   Here, take it. Take it.

6421   6425   - It's so light.

6426   6430   The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

6431   6435   And it's times like that, my lad,

6435   6438   Here's a pretty thing.

6438   6439   Mithril.

6440   6444   As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

6445   6448   Let me see you put it on. Come on.

6456   6458   My old ring.

6459   6463   I should very much like...

6464   6467   ...to hold it again, one last time.

6485   6488   I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

6489   6493   I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

6498   6501   I'm sorry for everything.

6516   6520   The ring-bearer is setting out

6521   6524   On you who travel with him, no oath...

6524   6527   ...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

6531   6533   Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

6533   6537   May the blessings of elves and men...

6538   6541   ...and all free folk go with you.

6544   6548   The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

6566   6569   Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

6569   6571   Left.

6651   6655   We must hold to this course, west

6655   6659   If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan

6659   6663   From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

6663   6667   Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

6669   6670   Move your feet.

6670   6671   - You look good, Pippin.

6672   6673   Faster!

6674   6678   If anyone was to ask for my opinion,

6678   6681   ...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

6682   6684   Gandalf.

6685   6689   My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

6689   6694   No Gimli, I would not take the road through

6704   6705   Sorry!

6706   6707   Get him!

6709   6711   - For the Shire!

6712   6714   Gentlemen, that's enough.

6718   6719   You've got my arm!

6720   6722   - What is that?

6723   6725   It's moving fast.

6726   6728   Against the wind.

6729   6731   - Crebain from Dunland!

6731   6734   - Hurry!

6767   6769   Spies of Saruman.

6770   6773   The passage south is being watched.

6774   6777   We must take the pass of Caradhras.

6790   6792   Frodo!

6811   6813   Boromir.

6813   6817   It is a strange fate that we should

6818   6821   ...over so small a thing.

6824   6826   Such a little thing.

6826   6828   Boromir!

6828   6831   Give the ring to Frodo.

6841   6843   As you wish.

6843   6845   I care not.

6881   6885   So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

6886   6890   And if that fails, where then will you go?

6892   6895   If the mountain defeats you...

6895   6899   ... will you risk a more dangerous road?

6904   6911   Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!

6912   6914   There is a fell voice on the air.

6915   6916   Nai yarvaxea rasselya!

6916   6917   It's Saruman!

6926   6931   He's trying to bring down the mountain!

6931   6933   No!

6999   7001   We must get off the mountain!

7002   7006   Make for the Gap of Rohan,

7006   7009   The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

7010   7013   We cannot pass over a mountain.

7014   7016   Let us go through the mines of Moria.

7018   7022   Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

7023   7028   The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

7029   7033   You know what they awoke

7035   7038   Shadow and flame.

7042   7044   Let the ring-bearer decide.

7049   7051   We cannot stay here!

7051   7054   This will be the death of the hobbits.

7054   7056   Frodo?

7059   7062   We will go through the mines.

7063   7065   So be it.

7071   7075   Frodo, come and help an old man.

7079   7081   How is your shoulder?

7081   7084   - Better than it was.

7086   7088   You feel its power growing, don't you?

7089   7092   I've felt it too.

7092   7096   Evil will be drawn to you from

7096   7099   And, I fear, from within.

7102   7106   - Who then do I trust?

7106   7109   Trust your own strengths.

7109   7111   - What do you mean?

7112   7114   ...for good or for evil.

7114   7116   Some are greater than I am.

7117   7120   And against some I have not yet been tested.

7122   7123   The walls...

7124   7126   ...of Moria.

7132   7135   Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

7135   7139   Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find

7140   7142   Why doesn't that surprise me?

7150   7153   Well, let's see.

7154   7155   Ithildin.

7156   7159   It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

7173   7178   It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

7178   7183   - Speak, friend, and enter."

7183   7187   Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,

7211   7212   Nothing's happening.

7219   7223   I once knew every spell in

7224   7227   ...men and orcs.

7227   7228   What are you going to do, then?

7228   7230   Knock your head against these doors,

7231   7233   And if that does not shatter them...

7233   7236   ...and I am allowed a little

7236   7239   ...I will try to find the opening words.

7252   7255   Mines are no place for a pony.

7255   7259   - Even one so brave as Bill.

7260   7263   Go on, Bill. Go on.

7264   7267   Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

7274   7276   Do not disturb the water.

7277   7279   Oh, it's useless.

7291   7293   It's a riddle.

7296   7299   "Speak 'friend' and enter."

7300   7303   What's the elvish word for "friend"?

7304   7305   Mellon.

7323   7328   Soon, master elf, you will enjoy

7329   7334   Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

7336   7339   This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

7339   7342   And they call it a mine.

7342   7344   A mine!

7345   7348   This is no mine. It's a tomb.

7354   7356   No....

7357   7359   No!

7362   7363   Goblins.

7367   7371   We make for the Gap of Rohan.

7372   7375   Now, get out of here. Get out!

7378   7380   - Frodo!

7380   7382   Strider!

7382   7385   - Help!

7385   7386   Aragorn!

7397   7398   Frodo!

7424   7425   Into the mines!

7425   7428   - Legolas!

7433   7434   Run!

7451   7455   We now have but one choice.

7455   7460   We must face the long dark of Moria.

7460   7462   Be on your guard.

7462   7466   There are older and fouler things than orcs...

7466   7469   ...in the deep places of the world.

7478   7481   Quietly now.

7482   7485   Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

7531   7535   The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

7535   7538   ...or jewels...

7538   7541   ...but mithril.

7559   7564   Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings

7564   7568   - Oh, that was a kingly gift.

7568   7570   I never told him...

7571   7575   ...but its worth was greater

7588   7589   Pippin.

7610   7613   I have no memory of this place.

7615   7616   - Are we Lost?

7617   7619   - I think we are.

7619   7621   - Merry?

7621   7623   I'm hungry.

7634   7638   - There's something down there.

7639   7643   - Gollum?

7643   7647   - He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?

7648   7650   ...or was set loose.

7650   7654   Now the ring has brought him here.

7656   7659   He will never be rid of his need for it.

7660   7665   He hates and loves the ring,

7665   7670   Sméagol's life is a sad story.

7670   7676   Yes, Sméagol he was once called.

7677   7680   Before it drove him mad.

7680   7683   It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him

7683   7685   Pity?

7686   7689   It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

7690   7695   Many that live deserve death.

7696   7699   Can you give it to them, Frodo?

7701   7705   Do not be too eager to deal

7705   7708   Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

7709   7714   My heart tells me that Gollum has some

7716   7718   ...before this is over.

7720   7724   The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

7730   7734   I wish the ring had never come to me.

7735   7737   I wish none of this had happened.

7737   7742   So do all who live to see such times.

7743   7749   All we have to decide is what to do

7750   7754   There are other forces at work in this

7755   7757   Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

7758   7762   In which case, you also were meant to have it.

7762   7765   And that is an encouraging thought.

7770   7772   It's that way.

7772   7775   - He's remembered.

7775   7778   But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

7779   7784   If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

7799   7803   Let me risk a little more light.

7808   7810   Behold...

7810   7815   ...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

7818   7821   Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

7846   7848   Gimli!

7855   7857   No!

7860   7863   Oh, no.

7865   7866   No.

7873   7875   "Here lies Balin...

7876   7878   ...son of Fundin...

7878   7880   ...Lord of Moria."

7882   7883   He is dead, then.

7885   7887   It's as I feared.

7905   7908   We must move on. We cannot linger.

7908   7913   "They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

7914   7916   We have barred the gates...

7917   7919   ...but cannot hold them for long.

7920   7922   The ground shakes.

7923   7924   Drums...

7925   7928   ...drums in the deep.

7932   7934   We cannot get out.

7936   7940   A shadow moves in the dark.

7941   7944   We cannot get out.

7947   7949   They are coming."

7992   7994   Fool of a Took!

7994   7998   Throw yourself in next time,

8024   8026   Frodo!

8028   8029   Orcs.

8037   8038   Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

8046   8047   They have a cave-troll.

8063   8064   Let them come!

8065   8068   There is one dwarf yet in Moria

8207   8210   I think I'm getting the hang of this.

8215   8217   Frodo!

8250   8252   Aragorn! Aragorn!

8253   8255   Frodo!

8300   8302   Frodo!

8362   8363   Oh, no.

8372   8374   He's alive.

8376   8379   I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

8379   8381   You should be dead.

8382   8384   That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

8384   8389   I think there's more to this

8395   8396   Mithril.

8399   8401   You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

8407   8409   To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

8424   8426   This way!

8497   8499   What is this new devilry?

8516   8518   A Balrog.

8519   8522   A demon of the ancient world.

8524   8526   This foe is beyond any of you.

8528   8529   Run!

8536   8538   Quickly!

8555   8556   Gandalf.

8557   8558   Lead them on, Aragorn.

8560   8562   The bridge is near.

8564   8568   Do as I say!

8597   8599   Gandalf!

8617   8619   Merry! Pippin!

8630   8631   Sam!

8634   8637   Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

8640   8642   Not the beard!

8655   8657   Steady.

8659   8660   Hold on!

8682   8683   Hang on!

8694   8695   Lean forward!

8698   8699   Steady.

8701   8702   Come on!

8702   8703   Now!

8721   8722   Over the bridge!

8723   8724   Fly!

8769   8771   You cannot pass!

8771   8773   Gandalf!

8777   8782   I am a servant of the secret fire,

8783   8787   The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

8797   8799   Go back to the Shadow.

8807   8811   You - shall not - pass!

8838   8842   - No! No!

8850   8852   Fly, you fools!

8856   8858   No!

8864   8867   Aragorn!

8924   8927   Legolas, get them up.

8931   8933   Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

8933   8936   By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

8937   8940   We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

8941   8944   Come, Boromir. Legolas.

8946   8948   On your feet, Sam.

8948   8950   Frodo?

8952   8954   Frodo!

9006   9009   Stay close, young hobbits!

9009   9013   They say that a great sorceress

9014   9016   An elf-witch...

9017   9020   ...of terrible power.

9020   9022   All who look upon her...

9023   9024   ...fall under her spell.

9025   9026   Frodo!

9028   9030   And are never seen again.

9030   9035   Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.

9035   9039   You bring great evil here, ring-bearer.

9039   9041   Mr. Frodo?

9046   9052   Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

9052   9056   I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

9064   9069   The dwarf breathes so loud, we

9087   9087   Haldir.

9087   9089   So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

9089   9091   Speak words we can all understand!

9091   9096   We have not had dealings with

9096   9099   And you know what this dwarf says to that?

9106   9108   That was not so courteous.

9114   9118   You bring great evil with you.

9120   9122   You can go no further.

9139   9142   Aragorn!

9160   9162   Gandalf's death was not in vain.

9163   9165   Nor would he have you give up hope.

9167   9170   You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

9171   9174   Don't carry the weight of the dead.

9177   9179   You will follow me.

9191   9193   Cares Galeton.

9193   9196   The heart of Elvendom on earth.

9196   9202   Realm of the Lord Celeborn

9281   9284   The enemy knows you have entered here.

9285   9290   What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

9292   9296   Eight there are here, yet nine there

9297   9298   Tell me, where is Gandalf?

9299   9302   For I much desire to speak with him.

9302   9304   I can no longer see him from afar.

9306   9310   Gandalf the Grey did not pass

9311   9313   He has fallen into shadow.

9318   9322   He was taken by both shadow and flame.

9324   9328   A Balrog of Morgoth.

9329   9332   For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

9334   9337   Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

9338   9341   We do not yet know his full purpose.

9346   9350   Do not let the great emptiness

9351   9353   ...Gimli, son of Gloin.

9354   9357   For the world has grown full of peril...

9359   9361   ...and in all lands...

9362   9365   ...love is now mingled with grief.

9378   9381   What now becomes of this fellowship?

9381   9384   Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

9387   9390   The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

9391   9393   Stray but a little and it will fail...

9394   9397   ...to the ruin of all.

9402   9407   Yet hope remains while the company is true.

9409   9413   Do not let your hearts be troubled.

9414   9418   ...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

9420   9422   Tonight, you will sleep....

9422   9426   Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

9427   9429   ...one who has seen the eye!

9444   9446   A lament for Gandalf.

9454   9455   What do they say about him?

9456   9458   I have not the heart to tell you.

9461   9463   For me, the grief is still too near.

9466   9469   I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

9469   9472   There should be a verse about them.

9476   9478   The finest rockets ever seen

9479   9482   They burst in stars of blue and green

9483   9488   Or after thunder, silver showers

9488   9491   Came falling like a rain of flowers

9492   9495   Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

9506   9509   Take some rest.

9509   9512   These borders are well-protected.

9512   9514   I will find no rest here.

9517   9520   I heard her voice inside my head.

9521   9524   She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

9524   9530   She said to me; "Even now there is hope Left."

9531   9534   But I cannot see it.

9535   9538   It is long since we had any hope.

9548   9550   My father is a noble man.

9551   9553   But his rule is failing...

9556   9559   ...and our people lose faith.

9560   9564   He looks to me to make things right,

9564   9568   I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

9571   9573   Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

9574   9576   The white tower of Ecthelion.

9576   9580   Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

9581   9584   Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

9587   9589   Have you ever been called home...

9589   9593   ...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

9594   9597   I have seen the white city...

9598   9599   ...long ago.

9600   9605   One day, our paths will lead us there.

9606   9609   And the tower guard shall take up the call:

9609   9613   "The Lords of Gondor have returned."

9680   9682   Will you look into the mirror?

9683   9684   What will I see?

9687   9689   Even the wisest cannot tell.

9690   9692   For the mirror...

9692   9695   ...shows many things.

9698   9700   Things that were...

9701   9703   ...things that are...

9704   9706   ...and some things...

9709   9713   ...that have not yet come to pass.

9795   9798   I know what it is you saw.

9801   9803   For it is also in my mind.

9805   9809   It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

9811   9816   The fellowship is breaking.

9817   9820   He will try to take the ring.

9820   9822   You know of whom I speak.

9823   9828   One by one, it will destroy them all.

9829   9832   If you ask it of me...

9832   9835   ... I will give you the One Ring.

9836   9839   You offer it to me freely.

9843   9847   I do not deny that my heart

9854   9857   In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen...

9857   9861   ...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

9862   9865   Treacherous as the sea!

9865   9870   Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

9871   9873   All shall love me...

9873   9876   ...and despair.

9890   9894   I pass the test. I will diminish...

9895   9897   ...and go into the West...

9897   9902   ...and remain Galadriel.

9905   9909   You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.

9910   9912   ...is to be alone.

9915   9918   This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

9918   9920   And I am its keeper.

9923   9927   This task was appointed to you.

9928   9931   And if you do not find a way...

9932   9934   ...no one will.

9934   9937   Then I know what I must do.

9938   9939   It's just...

9943   9945   ...I'm afraid to do it.

9948   9953   Even the smallest person can change

9959   9964   Do you know how the orcs first came into being?

9965   9968   They were elves once.

9970   9973   Taken by the dark powers...

9973   9976   ...tortured and mutilated.

9977   9982   A ruined and terrible form of life.

9982   9984   And now...

9986   9988   ...perfected.

9988   9991   My fighting Uruk-hai...

9993   9996   ...whom do you serve?

9996   9998   Saruman!

10019   10023   Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found.

10023   10026   You do not know pain.

10026   10029   You will taste man-flesh!

10034   10038   One of the halflings carries

10038   10042   Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

10044   10045   Kill the others.

10064   10070   Never before have we clad strangers

10071   10075   May these cloaks help shield

10082   10084   Lembas.

10084   10085   Elvish waybread.

10088   10091   One small bite is enough to fill

10097   10099   How many did you eat?

10099   10101   Four.

10107   10109   Every league you travel south,

10110   10114   Mordor orcs now hold the

10114   10116   Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

10117   10120   Strange creatures bearing the mark of the

10121   10126   Seldom do orcs journey in the open

10139   10143   By river you have the chance of outrunning

10160   10165   My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.

10165   10169   Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

10174   10177   These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

10177   10181   They have already seen service in war.

10181   10183   Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

10184   10187   You will find your courage.

10189   10191   And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

10191   10194   ...Elven rope made of hithlain.

10194   10196   Thank you, my lady.

10198   10201   Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

10207   10210   And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

10211   10213   Nothing.

10214   10217   Except to look upon the lady

10217   10222   ...for she is more fair than all

10230   10231   Actually....

10231   10233   There was one thing.

10234   10236   No, no, I couIdn't.

10237   10239   Stupid to ask.

10242   10244   I have nothing greater to give...

10244   10248   ...than the gift you already bear.

10273   10276   That choice is yet before her.

10277   10280   You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

10280   10286   To rise above the height of all your

10286   10291   ...or to fall into darkness

10318   10321   Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

10322   10325   I give you the light of Earendil...

10326   10328   ...our most beloved star.

10337   10342   May it be a light for you in dark places...

10342   10346   ... when all other lights go out.

10355   10358   I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

10359   10363   ...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

10364   10367   Henceforth I will call nothing fair

10367   10369   What was her gift?

10370   10374   I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

10375   10378   She gave me three.

10480   10484   Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

10488   10490   I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

10491   10494   But he's too clever a waterman.

10495   10498   And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

10498   10500   ...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

10501   10503   Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

10503   10506   - No, Sam.

10506   10509   You're not sleeping, neither.

10510   10513   - Mr. Frodo

10513   10515   But you're not.

10515   10517   I'm here to help you.

10518   10519   I promised Gandalf that I would.

10525   10528   You can't help me, Sam.

10530   10532   Not this time.

10535   10537   Get some sleep.

10543   10545   Minas Tirith is the safer road.

10546   10549   You know that.

10549   10551   Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

10552   10555   There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

10555   10557   You were quick enough to trust the elves.

10559   10562   Have you so little faith in your own people?

10562   10565   Yes, there is weakness.

10565   10568   But there is courage also,

10569   10571   But you will not see that.

10571   10573   You are afraid!

10573   10575   All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

10576   10579   Scared of who you are, of what you are.

10582   10586   I will not lead the ring within

10598   10599   Frodo.

10601   10603   The Argonath.

10606   10610   Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

10611   10612   My kin.

10692   10694   We cross the lake at nightfall.

10694   10696   Hide the boats and continue on foot.

10697   10700   - We approach Mordor from the North.

10701   10704   Just a simple matter of finding

10705   10708   ...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

10708   10711   And after that, it gets even better.

10711   10716   Festering, stinking marshland

10717   10718   That is our road.

10720   10723   I suggest you take some rest and

10723   10725   Recover my...

10728   10730   - We should Leave now.

10730   10734   Orcs patrol the eastern shore.

10734   10738   It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

10738   10742   A shadow and a threat has

10743   10747   Something draws near.

10749   10754   Recover strength?

10754   10756   Where's Frodo?

10782   10784   None of us should wander alone.

10785   10787   You, least of all.

10787   10790   So much depends on you.

10791   10793   Frodo?

10800   10802   I know why you seek solitude.

10803   10806   You suffer. I see it day by day.

10807   10810   You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

10812   10815   There are other ways, Frodo.

10815   10819   - Other paths that we might take.

10819   10823   It would seem like wisdom but

10823   10826   Warning...against what?

10826   10828   We're all afraid, Frodo.

10829   10832   But to let that fear drive us,

10832   10836   ...don't you see that is madness?

10838   10841   I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

10843   10845   - If you would but lend me the ring.

10846   10850   - Why do you recoil? I am no thief.

10852   10855   What chance do you think you have?

10855   10860   They will find you.

10860   10864   And you will beg for death before the end!

10866   10868   You fool!

10868   10872   It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!

10872   10875   It should be mine! Give it to me!

10875   10877   - Give it to me!

10877   10879   - Give it to me!

10886   10888   I see your mind.

10889   10891   You will take the ring to Sauron!

10892   10894   You will betray us!

10894   10897   You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

10897   10901   Curse you!

10908   10910   Frodo?

10914   10916   Frodo.

10920   10921   What have I done?

10922   10923   Please, Frodo.

10924   10926   Frodo, I'm sorry!

10957   10960   Ash Ghurûm

10975   10976   Frodo?

10978   10981   - It has taken Boromir.

10981   10983   Stay away!

10983   10985   Frodo!

10987   10991   - I swore to protect you.

11001   11003   Would you destroy it?

11008   11010   Aragorn.

11013   11016   Aragorn.

11018   11019   Elessar.

11027   11030   I would have gone with you to the end.

11031   11034   Into the very fires of Mordor.

11037   11038   I know.

11041   11046   Look after the others. Especially Sam.

11050   11052   Go, Frodo!

11055   11056   Run.

11056   11058   Run!

11083   11084   Mr. Frodo!

11094   11095   Find the halfling!

11097   11099   Find the halfling!

11103   11105   Elendil!

11111   11113   Aragorn, go!

11134   11136   Frodo!

11136   11138   Hide here. Quick!

11139   11140   Come on!

11143   11145   What's he doing?

11149   11151   He's leaving.

11156   11158   - No!

11163   11166   Run, Frodo. Go!

11166   11169   - Hey! Hey, you!

11170   11171   - Over here!

11182   11185   - It's working!

11240   11243   - The horn of Gondor.

11286   11287   Run!

11499   11500   No.

11504   11507   - They took the little ones.

11508   11510   Frodo. Where is Frodo?

11512   11513   I let Frodo go.

11514   11516   Then you did what I could not.

11517   11521   I tried to take the ring from him.

11521   11525   - The ring is beyond our reach now.

11526   11528   I did not see it.

11528   11531   - I have failed you all.

11532   11534   You fought bravely.

11535   11537   You have kept your honor.

11538   11540   Leave it.

11540   11542   It is over.

11543   11549   The world of men will fall and

11549   11552   ...and my city to ruin.

11556   11559   I do not know what strength is in my blood...

11559   11563   ...but I swear to you, I will

11564   11566   ...nor our people fail.

11567   11569   Our people.

11573   11575   Our people.

11597   11599   I would have followed you, my brother.

11601   11603   My captain.

11606   11608   My king.

11627   11629   Be at peace...

11630   11632   ...son of Gondor.

11648   11652   They will look for his coming from the white tower.

11652   11655   But he will not return.

11679   11680   Frodo!

11700   11703   I wish the ring had never come to me.

11704   11707   I wish none of this had happened.

11710   11713   So do all who live to see such times...

11713   11717   ...but that is not for them to decide.

11717   11720   All you have to decide...

11720   11725   ...is what to do with the time that is given to you.

11753   11755   Frodo, no!

11756   11757   Frodo!

11758   11761   - Mr. Frodo!

11764   11766   Go back, Sam!

11767   11770   - I'm going to Mordor alone.

11771   11773   And I'm coming with you!

11774   11776   You can't swim!

11780   11782   Sam!

11787   11789   Sam!

11830   11832   I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

11833   11837   A promise:

11838   11841   And I don't mean to.

11841   11843   I don't mean to.

11845   11847   Oh Sam.

11862   11863   Come on.

11892   11896   Hurry! Frodo and Sam have

11911   11916   - You mean not to follow them.

11920   11924   Then it has all been in vain.

11936   11939   Not if we hold true to each other.

11941   11945   We will not abandon Merry and

11946   11951   Not while we have strength left.

11953   11955   We travel light.

11955   11957   Let us hunt some orc.

11960   11962   Yes!

11981   11982   Mordor.

11983   11986   I hope the others find a safer road.

11987   11990   Strider will look after them.

11991   11994   I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

11995   11997   We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

11997   11999   We may.

12001   12002   Sam...

12006   12008   ...I'm glad you are with me.
